   → sadness intent detected, context updates to negative

3. User: "Thank you for listening"
   → gratitude intent, shows empathy from previous context

4. User: "You're awesome!"
   → compliment intent, mood improves
```

**Check Console** (F12 → Console):
- Should show: 🎯 Intent detected, sentiment, score
- Should show: 📊 Context updated
- Should show: 👤 User name detected (if introduced)

```

## 🖥️ Access URLs

**Desktop Access**:

## 🐛 Debugging

**Open Browser Console** (F12):
1. Look for intent detection logs: `🎯 Intent detected`
2. Check sentiment analysis: `Sentiment: positive/negative/neutral`
3. View context updates: `📊 Context updated`
4. See response fetching: `Conversational response:`
5. Monitor name detection: `👤 User name detected`

**Common Issues**:
- ❌ No badge appearing → Check console for errors
- ❌ Generic response → Intent not matching patterns
- ❌ Database error → Verify XAMPP MySQL is running
- ❌ Slow response → Check network/database connection

---

## ✨ Expected User Experience

### Visual Flow:
1. User types message → Sends
2. Typing indicator appears (3 animated dots)
3. Intent badge appears (colored, with emoji)
4. Bot response appears below badge
5. Smooth scroll to bottom
6. Ready for next message

### Intent Badge Format:
```
[emoji] Intent: [type] | [sentiment_emoji] [⚡ if intense]

Example: 💖 Intent: love | 😊 ⚡
```
