### Automatic Name Extraction:
The bot automatically understands these as "Smith":
- "schedule of Smith"
- "Smith's schedule"
- "show Smith schedule"
- "when does Smith teach"
- "Professor Smith schedule"

### Filters Out Noise:
Removes these words automatically:
- "show", "view", "display", "the", "a", "an", "all"

### Handles Variations:
All these work the same:
