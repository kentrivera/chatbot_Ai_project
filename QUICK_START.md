**Problem**: "Table doesn't exist" error
**Solution**: Run update_database_professor_role.sql

**Problem**: Can't login as professor
**Solution**: Check users table has role = 'professor'

**Problem**: Session expires immediately
**Solution**: Check PHP session settings in php.ini

**Problem**: Security warnings
**Solution**: Ensure security_config.php exists and is readable

## üìä Database Check

Run this query to verify setup:
```sql
-- Check if professor role exists
SELECT role, COUNT(*) as count 
FROM users 
GROUP BY role;

-- professor: 1+

-- Check new columns exist
DESCRIBE users;

-- Should show:
-- professor_id, email, last_login, status
```
